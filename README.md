# Neural Architectures for Sequential Recommendation based on Variational Autoencoders

This notebook accompanies the paper, "Neural Architectures for Sequential Recommendation based on Variational Autoencoders" by Giuseppe Manco, Francesco Pisani, Ettore Ritacco, Noveen Sachdeva.

The notebook provides PyTorch code for the proposed models, "SVAE" and VPR, along with the data preprocessing for the Movielens-1M dataset.
